            <p class="lead featurette-text">
                Export finance is a loan or financing facility that is extended to overseas projects and buyers that make
                use of exported goods and services from a given country. The loan is guaranteed against default by the
                government of the country benefiting from the export of goods and services.
            </p>
            <p class="lead featurette-text">
                An example of how an export finance loan might be structured is outlined below:

            <h3 class="featurette-heading" style="margin-top: 0">Low risk</h3>
            <p class="lead featurette-text">
                One of the key tenets of a balanced investment portfolio is the holding of a portion of capital where it can be preserved or protected against loss.
            </p>
            <p class="lead featurette-text">
                Export finance, by its very nature, provides capital preservation. While the end borrowers may originate from a wide variety of risk profiles, each investment in export finance is backed by a Government that will benefit from increased export activity.
            </p>
            <p class="lead featurette-text">
                In the event of a default, a majority portion (typically 100%) of the loan is insured and will be paid back by the supporting Government.
            </p>

    <div class="row grey-background">

            <h3 class="featurette-heading">Competitive returns</h3>
            <p class="lead featurette-text">
                While the risk profile of export finance investments is similar to that of Gilt/Treasury instruments, returns are often higher, with typical yields in the region of 80-120 basis points over LIBOR.
            </p>
            <p class="lead featurette-text">
                Returns vary depending on the project type and terms and the credit worthiness of the borrower. However, the underlying risk profile of the investment is not affected and remains linked to that of the Government backing the loan.
            </p>
            <p class="lead featurette-text">
                Both fixed and floating returns are available, providing flexibility and opportunities to hedge against inflation.

            <h3 class="featurette-heading">Diversification</h3>
            <p class="lead featurette-text">
                Diversification is an important factor in most investment portfolios and the unique risk profile of export finance offers considerable opportunities for the further diversification of existing portfolios.
            </p>
            <p class="lead featurette-text">
                Export finance is an ideal investment to further diversify existing portfolios that offer low risk, consistent returns with capital protection. While export finance enjoys government guarantees, the performance of the investment is not tightly coupled to that of the backing government. This provides diversification to funds that already hold fixed income instruments such as government bonds, gilts and treasuries.

            <p class="lead featurette-text">
                Loans will always be invested in major infrastructure projects, many of which will benefit from a green environmental designation, which improve the economic prospects of the borrowing country.
            </p>
            <p class="lead featurette-text">
                As per design, export finance increases exports and promotes economic growth in the jurisdiction of the government backing the loan.
            </p>
            <p class="lead featurette-text">
                This leads to an investment product with a range of benefits that enjoys substantial political will.
